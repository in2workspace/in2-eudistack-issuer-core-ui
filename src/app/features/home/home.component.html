        This site is intended for Legal Representatives of companies who want to
        issue one or more LEARCredentials to one or more employees of the
        company. A LEARCredential is a type of Verifiable Credential which
        enables an employee, nominated by a legal representative, to act on
        behalf of an organisation with restricted power with respect to
        third-parties.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The issuer of the LEARCredential
          <strong>must be a legal representative</strong> of the company. The
          legal representative will sign the LEARCredential with an eIDAS
          digital certificate, which can be either a personal one or a
          certificate of representation.
        </li>
        <li>
          The receiver of the LEARCredential (both the subject and holder of the
          credential) <strong>can be any employee (or contractor)</strong> of
          the company. The legal representative will delegate a restricted set
          of power to that person. Those restricted power are included inside
          the credential and can be verified by any Relying party to whom the
          holder presents the LEARCredential.
        </li>
      </ul>

        You must be a legal representative of the company, to be able to
        delegate the restricted power required for DOME.
      </p>
      <p>
        You need an eIDAS certificate to be able to use the system. In addition
        you will have to register your company email.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: if you are reading this in your mobile, most probably the button
        will not work, unless you have installed your eIDAS certificate in the
        mobile. You typically need to use a PC, with the certificate installed
        in the browser.
